# RumorDetection
The project extracts social circles from egocentric networks, capturing users' behavioral preferences based on interests, communication frequency, and relationships. By integrating BERT with RDMSC, it generates rich contextual embeddings of textual content within these circles. This enhances the model's ability to capture nuanced contextual information and utilize semantic representations, leading to more accurate rumor detection. Ultimately, the augmented RDMSC model significantly improves the identification and mitigation of misinformation on social media platforms.
